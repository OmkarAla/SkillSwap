SkillSwap Project: Full Idea
SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer skill exchange platform where users can:

Register/Login: Create accounts and authenticate.
Manage Profiles: Specify skills they offer (e.g., guitar lessons) and seek (e.g., cooking tips).
Find Matches: Discover users with complementary skills (e.g., offers what you seek, seeks what you offer).
Schedule Sessions: Arrange skill exchange sessions, synced with Google Calendar.
Rate Users: Provide feedback to build trust.

The single users collection in MongoDB Atlas stores all user data 
(email, password, offers, seeks, sessions, ratings), leveraging MongoDBâ€™s NoSQL flexibility. 
The MERN stack powers the application, with MongoDB for VS Code for database management.
